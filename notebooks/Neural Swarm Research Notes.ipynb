To limit development requirements, the entire hardware swarm will be run virtually on a computer, and commands passed back to individual units. This will simulate each agent having its own intelligence without having to actually design a version of the software that is compatible with Sphero."

    "   For development, I focus on simulation. However, I may be able to deploy the project to a small swarm of Sphero robot balls. Deployment may or may not occur depending on how well development goes. I will use <a href=\"https://github.com/zdanowiczkonrad/PythonSphero\">PythonSphero</a> which implements the <a href=\"https://github.com/karol-szuster/kulka\">kulka</a> Sphero API. The swarm simulation is based on basic cellular automata. Rather than following formulated rules, behavior is governed by a neural network. I am using a base swarm class from github user <a href='https://github.com/elmar-hinz/'>elmar-hinz</a> called <a href='https://github.com/elmar-hinz/Python.Swarms'>Python.Swarms</a>. It was developed in Python 2.7 for visualization in a terminal class called curses. So, I have adapted it for Python 3 and display in Jupyter Notebooks. "
