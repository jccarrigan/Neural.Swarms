# Neural.Swarms
Python swarm simulation with neural net based agents. Once development reaches a certain goal, everything will move over to Sphero.Swarms, where I'll try to deploy the agents to Sphero robot balls using the kulka library.

```

Framework to create different swarms by writing classes of swarm behaviour strategies.

The strategy can either result from the behaviour of the single figures (like ants, bees or robots)
or be fully supervised on the game level like in chess or be a combination of both like in economy, society or war.

The program uses python, jupyter, and keras with a theano back end. It will run on most Unix (Linux, Mac) but probably not directly on Windows.

It's coded with Python 3.6 on Mac OS X.
